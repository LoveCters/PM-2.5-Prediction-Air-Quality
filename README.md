# Air Quality Prediction (PM2.5) with LSTM

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting **PM2.5 air pollution levels** using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model. The model leverages historical air quality data, preprocesses it into a time-series format, and predicts future PM2.5 concentrations.
The prediction system is designed for **Ho Chi Minh City**, but can be adapted to other locations with appropriate datasets.
